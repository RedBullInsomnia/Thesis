\section{Scope}
The scope of this thesis is to provide the team with a simulation tool and a model able of :
\begin{itemize}
\item simulating realistic inertias
\item receiving orders at approximately 300Hz
\item simulate friction realistically
\item incorporate springs and dampers
\item visualization
\end{itemize}

The model should also receive the same orders as the real robot.
