In this chapter we discuss the choice of V-rep as the simulation tool for this project. We begin by explaining the basics of rigid body dynamics simulation, take a survey of some of the existing simulators and finally test some of them.

\section{Simulation of rigid body dynamics}

\section{Available simulators}
The basis of the simulation is the ability to simulate the dynamics of the robot and the friction with the soil. So, something bare-bone as Matlab or bullet could be used, 

\cite{blender_for_robotics}
The list of physics simulating engines is quite long, but the most popular ones are, in no particular order :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bullet
\item ODE
\item DART
\item Simbody
\item PhysX
\item Havok
\end{enumerate}
Bullet was chosen because while it does not distinguish itself when it comes to pure physical simulation \cite{engines_comparison}, a 3D modelling application called Blender is built atop of it, providing excellent tools for fast and easy robot modelisation. Blender also provides access to Bullet through a well document Python API.

\section{Tested simulators}
Blender is originally a 3D modelling and rendering software. It uses the Bullet physics engine to simulate realistic physics in animations. It has a Python interface which can be used to script a simulation.

V-rep integrates a simulator that can run on different physics engines and supports remote operation.
