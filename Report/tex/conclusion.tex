\section{Conclusion}
This is the conclusion to my work.

\section{Future work}
\subsection{Modelling}
As of now it is still uncertain if Blender shall continue to support the COLLADA format (as explained in \cite{blender_roadmap}). In the negative, another tool should be chosen to perform the modelling.

The springs also need some work, as of now they are just there as a proof of concept but their parameters will need to be tuned.

As of now, the model uses simplified inertias, in the belief that a controller should be able to correct minor differences in behaviour between the model and the actual robot. In the case, theses inertias need to be more accurate, we suggest to use Meshlab\footnote{\url{http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/}} to compute the inertias of those objects.
