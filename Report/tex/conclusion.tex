\section{Conclusion}
This is the conclusion to my work.

\section{Future work}
\subsection{Modelling}
As of now it is still uncertain if Blender shall continue to support the COLLADA format (as explained in \cite{blender_roadmap}). In the negative, another tool should be chosen to perform the modelling.

The springs also need some work, as of now they are just there as a proof of concept but their parameters will need to be tuned.
