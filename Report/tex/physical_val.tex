\section{Experimental set-up}
The set-up consists in :
\begin{itemize}
\item A camera that films the movements of a servo configuration.
\item A simulation of that servo configuration in V-Rep.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments}
The first experiment is to test the torque : to that end, a frame is fixed onto a single servo and weighted. 

At $12V$, the torque\cite{mx_28_manual} of the servo is supposedly $2.5N.m$. With a hinge of length $2cm$ the servo should be able to handle $12.5Kg$ since 
\begin{align*}
2.5 &= x \cdot 0.02\\
x &= 125 N\\
&= 12.74 kg
\end{align*}
