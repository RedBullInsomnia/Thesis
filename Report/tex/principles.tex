In this chapter we discuss the choice of V-rep as the simulation tool for this project. We begin by explaining the basics of rigid body dynamics simulation, take a survey of some of the existing simulators and finally test some of them.

\section{Principles of rigid body dynamics simulation}
The section is heavily inspired by \cite{bender2014interactive}.
The basic idea behind the simulation of physics on a computer is to discretize time and apply the laws of newton to each object in the scene and integrate their acceleration during the timestep. When objects collide, collision.

A rigid body is an idealized solid object which will never change its shape, even under high forces.
